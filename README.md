This project requires the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) SDK which includes the Dart tools.
Please follow the official installation guide for your platform:
<https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>.

For convenience, a simple setup script is provided in `scripts/install_flutter.sh`.
It installs Flutter on Linux and adds it to the `PATH` for the current session.

```bash
scripts/install_flutter.sh
```

After installation you can verify your setup with `flutter doctor`.
