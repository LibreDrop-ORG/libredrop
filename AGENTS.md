# AGENT Instructions

This repository contains a Flutter application for local network file sharing.

## Coding Guidelines
- Place all Dart/Flutter source files under the `lib/` directory.
- Keep `pubspec.yaml` up to date with any new dependencies.
- Format all Dart files using `dart format .` (or `flutter format .`) before committing.
- Ensure the app builds with `flutter analyze` to catch any static analysis issues.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` whenever new features or setup steps are added.

## Testing
- If any widget or unit tests are added, run `flutter test` and ensure it passes.
- At minimum, run `flutter analyze` after changes to verify there are no analyzer warnings.
